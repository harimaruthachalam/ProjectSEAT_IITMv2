            <p class="lead">SEAT stands for Student Elective Allocation Tool.</p>
			Starting from the 2015 batch, the curriculum for B.Tech. and Dual Degree students has been
			revised to include many more electives ​​. There is a significant increase from the
			number of electives that were allowed in the old curriculum. Students have flexibility in
			choosing electives from other departments starting as early as in their third semester. To
			enable students to have choice in electives that they wish to pursue, all departments are
			requested to allow (a fixed number of) students from other departments in all their courses,
			including core courses. In this context, an offline process may not be a viable solution given
			that many students will credit electives across departments. SEAT is a tool envisioned to
			enable students to express preferences over courses, instructors to provide criteria for
			selection and ranking of students, and finally produce a fair allocation of elective courses to
			students.<br/><br/>
			SEAT ensures that course capacities, prerequisites for courses are treated as hard
			constraints that will not be violated. In addition, for every student, the allotments are free of
			slot-conflicts and the number of credits allotted is within the credit limit provided by the
			student.</br><br/>
			SEAT operates in 2 rounds. Any modifications to the allotment after the 2nd round is outside
			the purview of SEAT.
